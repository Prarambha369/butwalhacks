getting started, run the following in your terminal:

Download the code to your computer:

## Consistency and Best Practices

The project follows Next.js best practices for file extensions:

1. **Consistent Extensions**: All React components and pages use the `.js` extension consistently
2. **Proper Organization**: Files are organized in appropriate directories based on their purpose
3. **Clear Documentation**: File extension usage is now well-documented for future contributors

And then open up your web browser and go to [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

Please note: There are a number of redirects and rewrites essential to the website's functionality, which you can see
in [next.config.mjs](./next.config.mjs).

Join us in building HackClub Butwal's homepage and show new hackers what HackClub could be for them 💖.

See something that could be better? Make a PR! Have an easter egg idea? Make a PR! Is the site missing something? Make a
PR! _(Do you see a trend? :))_

If you need to add content to the site, here's how you can:

<details> <summary>Create a new card</summary>

<img width="600" alt="Screenshot 2023-08-16 at 9 09 55 PM" src="https://github.com/hackclub/site/assets/65808924/fed45800-c834-4e4c-ad87-a21e01414fa9">

Most things on the homepage are carousel, modular components that can easily be added and removed according to relevancy
to Hack Clubbers. There are 3 main sections: connection, open-source, and IRL community. Most new carousel will likely
fall within the first two sections!

First, you can create a new file under [components/index/carousel](components/index/cards/) with the name of your new
event/project. Next add `import CardModel from './card-model'` and add whatever you want :) Finally, use a <Buttons>
component (`import Buttons from './button'`) to highlight call-to-action buttons. If it's the main button, use the
primary prop to add a background color!

Your challenge: try and make the card as unique as possible, like a mini poster! Not sure where to start? Look at other
carousel on the page :)

</details>

<details>
<summary>Add to the carousel</summary>

<img width="600" alt="Screenshot 2023-08-16 at 9 09 11 PM" src="https://github.com/hackclub/site/assets/65808924/044660eb-fb3d-43b6-a270-64a3fe51f3ca">

If there's a Hack Club or Hack Club community-led project (past or present) that Hack Clubbers can get involved in,
please add it to [lib/carousel.json](lib/carousel.json) and add your card to the end of the json file. An example looks
like this:

```json
{
  "background": "dark",
  "titleColor": "white",
  "descriptionColor": "white",
  "title": "Hackers Wanted",
  "description": "Our open love letter to hackers",
  "img": "https://a.slack-edge.com/production-standard-emoji-assets/14.0/apple-large/1f4bb@2x.png",
  "link": "/hackers-wanted"
}
```

</details>
